## Website

- Measure 1: Calls for Field-Specific Actions
- https://ethrat.ch/en/measure-1-calls-for-field-specific-actions/
- Explore projects will allow early phase exploration, testing and
  prototyping of what an ORD practice could be like. They will enable
  starting to engage with a community without necessarily building up
  something definitive. The aim is to help our researchers to explore if
  ORD practices can be developed and how.

## Aims

Funding for “Explore projects” aims at:

1.  Specifying ORD standards.
2.  Prototyping ORD tools.
3.  Building Communities to engage in ORD practices.
4.  Any other means that help explore and develop ORD practices.

It is important that Explore projects are not self-centred but emphasize
exchanges in the spirit of Open Science with other researchers,
technical experts, and stakeholders.

## Application guidelines (ETH Domain)

- https://ethrat.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Application-Guidelines_TrackA_Explore_2nd_call_FINAL.pdf
- It is the declared goal to fund proposals that make tools (e.g.,
  software; hardware; protocols; standards; benchmarks; documentation
  and training materials; networking and education events, activities
  and resources) available which enable, facilitate and foster sharing
  research data based on ORD principles. Preference will be given to
  projects which engage and are connected to a community. Therefore,
  applicants are strongly invited to demonstrate why their project
  represents an ORD practice that encourages good research in their
  field.

## openwashdata community

The openwashdata community has found its home. Thanks to the funding we
received from the first call for Explore projects by the ETH Board, we
have successfully fostered a community of individuals who share a keen
interest in open data and open code within the broader Water,
Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) sector. We have established a website
that attracts 10 visitors daily, disseminate a monthly newsletter that
reaches 200 people, and maintain a community chat with 100 active
members. We also run a 10-week data science programme that has produced
40 graduates. Most importantly, we have developed a clear and efficient
data publishing workflow for datasets and code. We have successfully
achieved the objectives of all our work packages. As we transition into
the next phase of the openwashdata project, our aim is to lay the
groundwork for long-term sustainability

## Strategic partnerships

The inaugural year of our project has opened doors to potential
collaborations with various institutions and organizations. We envision
a more hands-on approach by embedding a data steward within these
entities. This steward will collaborate with the organization to
identify existing ORD practices, formulate a preliminary data management
strategy, pinpoint datasets ready for open publication, and discern
datasets requiring careful scrutiny before publication due to ethical
approvals, data privacy, or industry partnerships. Our openwashdata team
will provide the steward with comprehensive guidance and technical
support. These partnerships will bolster the reputation of the Global
Health Engineering group at ETH Zurich as a pioneer in open data and
open code within WASH sector. Together with our partners, we aim to
introduce ORD practices (e.g. Data Management Strategy & Data Management
Plans) to the WASH sector

### UKZN WASH R&D Center

Established in 1971, the Water, Sanitation & Hygiene Research &
Development Centre (WASH R&D Centre) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal
in Durban, South Africa, is a transdisciplinary research and development
hub. Formerly known as the Pollution Research Group, the centre has
become a leader in WASH R&D, providing a platform for testing innovative
sanitation solutions for both local and international service providers.
Both, Prof. Elizabeth Tilley and Open Science Specialist Lars Schöbitz
have spend time at the the Centre as researchers between 2011 and 2015,
enabling a long lasting relationship build on trust and mutuality.

One of the centre’s key initiatives is the Sanitation Prototype
Field-Testing Platform. This platform is designed to expose sanitation
technologies to real-world conditions early in their development. It
achieves this by testing prototypes in informal settlements and rural
households in Durban, South Africa. From 2017 to 2020, nearly 20
prototype technologies were tested on this platform.

The platform is a result of a multidisciplinary partnership involving
university partners, local consultancy firm Khanyisa Projects, and the
local eThekwini Municipality’s Water and Sanitation Unit (EWS). On a
national level, the work was supported by the Water Research Commission
(WRC) and financially backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
(BMGF). Drawing from the experiences of prototyping various sanitation
technologies, the South African Sanitation Technology Enterprise
Programme (SASTEP) was established. The programme was created by the
Water Research Commission (WRC) in partnership with the Department of
Science and Innovation (DSI), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
(BMGF), with support from the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS).
The WASH R&D Centre serves as the research partner for the
implementation of the programme.

implementation of the programme.

Over the years, the WASH R&D Centre has amassed a significant amount of
data, including data from the Sanitation Prototype Field-Testing
Platform and the broader research community. This data is currently
stored in various locations, such as the university’s network drives,
the university’s data repository, and on the personal computers of
researchers, without a holistic data management strategy. While open
access journal publications from the research are available, the data is
not openly published and is not easily accessible to the research
community.

### BASEflow Malawi

BASEflow, a Malawian social enterprise established in 2017, is dedicated
to enhancing water security in the country. Operating from Blantyre,
this non-profit organization has a committed team of 15 individuals.
They have demonstrated leadership in data collection and sharing within
the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) sector in Malawi, offering
support to research institutions and government agencies in both data
collection and management. During the initial phase of openwashdata,
BASEflow published a dataset using the openwashdata workflow and has
expressed interest in continuing the collaboration to develop a
comprehensive data management strategy. This strategy aims to ensure
that all shareable data is openly published. BASEflow’s commitment to
data transparency is exceptional in the WASH sector, where non-academic
organizations typically have fewer incentives to share their data.
Nevertheless, the data they provide is invaluable and often in high
demand by government entities and researchers. By adopting this open
approach, BASEflow is poised to set a new standard for the sector and
gain recognition as a leader in promoting data openness.

## Governance

We recognize the necessity of a well-defined governance process and a
feedback mechanism for the project’s long-term success. We propose a
sounding board composed of community members to provide feedback on the
project’s direction. The governance process will outline decision-making
within the community, contributing to the establishment of a sustainable
funding strategy for the openwashdata community

## Community building

With an impressive 222 sign-ups, we launched a 10-week data science
program that has made a significant contribution to the growth of our
community. Each module, lasting 2.5 hours, devoted roughly one-third of
the time to break-out sessions where participants, in groups of two or
three, collaboratively tackled coding assignments. This approach has
fostered a network of individuals who are not only connected but also
share a unified understanding of the data science workflow we advocate
for within the community. We’ve noticed that participants began
collaborating on homework assignments and sharing contact details to
stay connected beyond the course. All graduates have completed and
published a full data science report on GitHub Pages, along with the
corresponding data in a GitHub repository. We are excited to continue
our engagement with the course participants by offering additional
training in data publishing workflows and advanced data science topics.
Moreover, we plan to refine the course content for a second iteration,
which we aim to offer in the first quarter, contingent upon the approval
of our funding proposal. This course is poised to be a catalyst for
community expansion. Our vision is that, in time, the course will be led
by various community members, further embedding the spirit of
collaboration and knowledge-sharing that defines our initiative.

## Increase FAIRness

The initial phase of our project successfully established a data
publishing workflow that adheres to FAIR data practices and the highest
standards of rigor, transparency, and reproducibility. All work is under
git version control, publicly available on Github, and archived on
Zenodo. This includes the submitted raw data, the code required to
process and prepare the data for analysis, and the code needed to
generate figures and tables for articles on websites created to
publicize and curate the data. We publish the website using the R data
package ecosystem, which provides templates for detailed documentation
and metadata provision for each dataset. Assigning a DOI through Zenodo
and adding all authors through ORCID id ensures the data is findable and
reusable.

In the next phase, we aim to enhance the findability of our data
packages. We plan to identify a list of existing metadata standards and
schemas suitable for further publication, and develop the necessary code
to transform the data package into these standards (e.g., JSON Table
Schema of Frictionless Standards, Dublin Core Metadata Element Set).

While our data is easily accessible to the R community and we continue
to provide CSV and XLSX formats, we recognize that a significant portion
of the scientific community uses Python. Therefore, we will explore ways
to make our datasets more interoperable and accessible to the Python
community by prototyping Python data packages for the pip and conda
package managers.

Currently, our R data packages are installed from Github using the
remotes or devtools R packages. The effort required to submit all
datasets to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is currently too
time-intensive to justify. However, we plan to explore the development
of an R package and its submission to CRAN, which would provide a way to
explore all published datasets and install them through this package.
Publishing an R package on CRAN will significantly enhance the
findability of our data and further streamline the process of exploring
and reusing the data.

Lastly, we will utilize existing tools to assess the FAIRness of our
datasets and use the results to further enhance the FAIRness of our
datasets.

## Problem statement

Within its inaugural year, the Global Health Engineering group has
successfully cultivated a ORD community WASH sector. We have defined ORD
standards for data packages, evaluated and chosen tools and platforms
for ORD practices, and established a vibrant and engaged community. As
we embark on the next phase, our goal is to lay the groundwork for the
community’s long-term sustainability and to enhance the application of
FAIR principles to the data we publish. This phase will provide us with
the opportunity to seek and develop partnerships that the Global Health
Engineering group can leverage even after the project concludes.
