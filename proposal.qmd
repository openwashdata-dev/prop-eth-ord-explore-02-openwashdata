## openwashdata community 

The openwashdata community has found its home. Thanks to the funding we received from the first call for Explore projects by the ETH Board, we have successfully fostered a community of individuals who share a keen interest in open data and open code within the broader Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) sector.

### Organigram

This proposal is outlined along the figure below which can serve as an overall organigram of the different openwashdata elements.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/openwashdata-vision.png")
```

### Phase 1

We have established a website for the openwashdata community that attracts 10 unique visitors daily, disseminate a monthly newsletter that reaches 200 people, and maintain a community chat with 100 active members. 

We also established the openwashdata academy with our 10-week "data science for openwashdata" training programme, which has produced 40 graduates. 

Lastly, and most importantly, we started "openwashdata publishing" a clear and efficient data publishing workflow for datasets and code that follows FAIR principles and highest standards for computational reproducibility and version control. 

We have successfully achieved the objectives of all our work packages in phase 1. As we transition into the next phase of, our aim is to lay the groundwork for long-term sustainability of ORD practices in the sector. 

### Phase 2

The core of this proposal as we transition into phase 2 openwashdata community is to extend the established openwashdata academy and further invest into the openwashdata publishing arm of the community. We will also setup a governance structure and sounding board to ensure the long-term sustainability of the community.

## openwashdata academy

Next to the 10-week "data science for openwashdata" training programme, we will develop a 12-module "data stewardship for openwashdata" training programme, offered to a newly established data stewardship network.

### data science for openwashdata 

With an impressive 222 sign-ups, we launched a 10-week data science program that has made a significant contribution to the growth of our community. Each module, lasting 2.5 hours, devoted roughly one-third of the time to break-out sessions where participants, in groups of two or three, collaboratively tackled coding assignments. This approach has fostered a network of individuals who are not only connected but also share a unified understanding of the data science workflow we advocate for within the community. We've noticed that participants began collaborating on homework assignments and sharing contact details to stay connected beyond the course. All graduates have completed and published a full data science report on GitHub Pages, along with the corresponding data in a GitHub repository. 

We intend to invite the graduates to a newly established data stewardship network and continue our engagement by offering additional training in the openwashdata data publishing workflow. 

### data stewarship network

We envision a more hands-on approach by embedding a data steward within two entities. This steward will collaborate with the organization to identify existing ORD practices, formulate a preliminary data management strategy, pinpoint datasets ready for open publication, and discern datasets requiring careful scrutiny before publication due to ethical approvals, data privacy, or industry partnerships. Our openwashdata team will provide the steward with comprehensive guidance and technical support. These partnerships will bolster the reputation of the Global Health Engineering group at ETH Zurich as a pioneer in open data and open code within WASH sector. Together with our partners, we aim to introduce ORD  practices (e.g. Data Management Strategy & Data Management Plans) to the WASH sector.

In addition to these two core data stewards, we will identify graduates of our first "data science for openwashdata" course to become part of the data stewardship network, limiting it to six individuals in total for the beginning year.

#### UKZN WASH R&D Center

Established in the 1970s, the Water, Sanitation & Hygiene Research & Development Centre (WASH R&D Centre) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa, is a transdisciplinary research and development hub. Formerly known as the Pollution Research Group, the Centre has become a leader in WASH R&D, providing a platform for testing innovative sanitation solutions for both local and international service providers and technology developers. Both, Prof. Elizabeth Tilley and Open Science Specialist Lars Schöbitz have spent time at the Centre as researchers between 2011 and 2015, enabling a long lasting relationship built on trust and mutuality.

One of the Centre’s key initiatives from 2017 to 2023 was the Sanitation Engineering Field-Testing (EFT) Platform. This platform was designed to expose sanitation technologies to real-world conditions early in their development. It achieved this by testing prototypes in informal settlements and rural households in Durban, South Africa. From 2017 to 2020, nearly 20 prototype technologies were tested on this platform

The platform is a result of a multidisciplinary partnership involving university partners, local consultancy firm Khanyisa Projects, and the local eThekwini Municipality’s Water and Sanitation Unit (EWS). On a national level, the work was supported by the Water Research Commission (WRC) and financially backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). Drawing from the experiences of prototyping various sanitation technologies, the South African Sanitation Technology Enterprise Programme (SASTEP) was established. The programme was created by the Water Research Commission (WRC) in partnership with the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), with support from the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). The WASH R&D Centre serves as the research partner for the implementation of the programme, utilizing the systems established under the EFT platform.

Over the years, the WASH R&D Centre has amassed a significant amount of data on WASH related topics, including data from the EFT Platform and the broader research community. This data is currently stored in various locations, such as the university’s network drives, the university’s data repository, the technology developers’ systems and on the personal computers of researchers, without a holistic data management strategy. While open access journal publications from the research are available, the data is not openly published and is not easily accessible to the research community.

#### BASEflow Malawi

BASEflow, a Malawian social enterprise established in 2017, is dedicated to enhancing water security in the country. Operating from Blantyre, this non-profit organization has a committed team of 15 individuals. They have demonstrated leadership in data collection and sharing within the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) sector in Malawi, offering support to research institutions and government agencies in both data collection and management. During the initial phase of openwashdata, BASEflow published a dataset using the openwashdata workflow and has expressed interest in continuing the collaboration to develop a comprehensive data management strategy. This strategy aims to ensure that all shareable data is openly published. BASEflow's commitment to data transparency is exceptional in the WASH sector, where non-academic organizations typically have fewer incentives to share their data. Nevertheless, the data they provide is invaluable and often in high demand by government entities and researchers. By adopting this open approach, BASEflow is poised to set a new standard for the sector and gain recognition as a leader in promoting data openness.

### data stewardship for openwashdata

This training will focus more holistically on data management and stewardship, including data management plans, data privacy, data ethics, and data publication. It will cover aspects of file organisation, file types, and different pathways for collaboration and task management. 

We will host modules to identify current file and data management practices within each organisation and support the definition of a strategy for (research) data management. Contrary to the "data science for openwashdata" training, we don’t prescribe one way of doing things but rather help determine the best practices for the group, allowing individuals to use the workflows and tools that suit them best to maintain autonomy, however encouraging best practices for ORD.

The programme will be a monthly offering of 12 modules, each of which consisting of a 1-hour teaching module, a 1-hour hands-on workshop, and a 1-hour discussion group exchange. 

## Governance

We recognize the necessity of a well-defined governance process and a feedback mechanism for the project's long-term success. We propose a sounding board composed of six members to provide feedback on the project's direction. The governance process will outline decision-making within the community and contribute to the establishment of a sustainable funding strategy for the openwashdata community

## openwashdata publishing

### Increase FAIRness

The initial phase of our project successfully established a data publishing workflow that adheres to FAIR data practices and the highest standards of rigor, transparency, and reproducibility. All work is under git version control, publicly available on Github, and archived on Zenodo. This includes the submitted raw data, the code required to process and prepare the data for analysis, and the code needed to generate figures and tables for articles on websites created to publicize and curate the data. We publish the website using the R data package ecosystem, which provides templates for detailed documentation and metadata provision for each dataset. Assigning a DOI through Zenodo and adding all authors through ORCID id ensures the data is findable and reusable.

In the next phase, we aim to enhance the findability of our data packages. We plan to identify a list of existing metadata standards and schemas suitable for further publication, and develop the necessary code to transform the data package into these standards (e.g., JSON Table Schema of Frictionless Standards, Dublin Core Metadata Element Set).

While our data is easily accessible to the R community and we continue to provide CSV and XLSX formats, we recognize that a significant portion of the scientific community uses Python. Therefore, we will explore ways to make our datasets more interoperable and accessible to the Python community by prototyping Python data packages for the pip and conda package managers.

Currently, our R data packages are installed from Github using the remotes or devtools R packages. The effort required to submit all datasets to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is currently too time-intensive to justify. However, we plan to explore the development of an R package and its submission to CRAN, which would provide a way to explore all published datasets and install them through this package. Publishing an R package on CRAN will significantly enhance the findability of our data and further streamline the process of exploring and reusing the data. 

Lastly, we will utilize existing tools to assess the FAIRness of our datasets and use the results to further enhance the FAIRness of our datasets.

### Journal for openwashdata

Under our publishing arm, we will start to identify the process of establishing our own journal for openwashdata. This purpose of this journal is not to highlight scientific results, but to provide a platform for data publishing. Our initial vision is to host this journal entirely through GitHub, using Quarto documents as a submission format, from which we can generate attractive online journal publication. The first issue of this journal will include the capstone project reports of graduates from our "data science for openwashdata" course offer. Further, we will use the R data packages created through our data publishing workflow as a submission format.
